<h1>💣 Ransomware Simulation in Python (Educational)</h1>

### 📺 [Watch Simulation Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_2)

---

<h2>📄 Overview</h2>

This project simulates the behavior of ransomware using Python, offering a safe and controlled way to understand the **mechanics of file encryption and decryption**. It's intended strictly for **educational and cybersecurity training** purposes.

---

<h2>🧩 Key Components</h2>

- **File Encryption**  
  Uses Python's `cryptography` module to encrypt files within a specified directory using a symmetric key.

- **Decryption Mechanism**  
  A built-in method allows recovery of files using the original key.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
  Simple interface to trigger encryption, decryption, and view logs.

---

<h2>⚠️ Ethical Guidance</h2>

- ❗ **Educational Use Only** – This simulation must **never** be used on unauthorized systems or for malicious purposes.  
- 🧪 **Simulated Ransom Note** – Optionally demonstrates how attackers leave ransom instructions.  
- 📊 **File Logging** – Tracks which files were encrypted/decrypted for forensics analysis.

---

<h2>🧰 Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

- Python 3.x  
- `cryptography` Python library  
- `os`, `shutil`, and `logging` modules  

---

<h2>💻 Usage Scenarios</h2>

- Teach ransomware behavior in cybersecurity awareness training  
- Demonstrate encryption/decryption for incident response teams  
- Practice reverse engineering or decryptor script development  

---

<h2>📁 Files in Repository</h2>

- `sim_ransomware.py` – Main simulation script  
- `decryptor.py` – Companion tool to reverse encryption  
- `README.md` – This file  
- `test_directory/` – Sample files for testing
